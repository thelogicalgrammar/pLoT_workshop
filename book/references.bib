  abstract = {How do humans encode spatial and sequential information in working memory? We tested the hypothesis that participants do not merely store each consecutive location in a distinct memory slot, but instead compress the whole sequence using an abstract language-like code that captures geometrical regularities at multiple nested levels. We exposed participants to sequences of fixed length but variable regularity, while their brain activity was recorded using magneto-encephalography. The entire sequence could be decoded from brain signals. Anticipation signals could also be decoded, and both behavior and anticipatory brain signals were modulated by sequence complexity, defined as the minimal description length provided by the formal language. Furthermore, abstract primitives of rotation and symmetry could be decoded both in isolation and within the sequences. These results suggest that humans encode the transitions between sequence items as rotations and symmetries, and compress longer sequences using nested repetitions of those primitives.},

  abstract = {During language processing, humans form complex embedded representations from sequential inputs. Here, we ask whether a "geometrical language" with recursive embedding also underlies the human ability to encode sequences of spatial locations. We introduce a novel paradigm in which subjects are exposed to a sequence of spatial locations on an octagon, and are asked to predict future locations. The sequences vary in complexity according to a well-defined language comprising elementary primitives and recursive rules. A detailed analysis of error patterns indicates that primitives of symmetry and rotation are spontaneously detected and used by adults, preschoolers, and adult members of an indigene group in the Amazon, the Munduruku, who have a restricted numerical and geometrical lexicon and limited access to schooling. Furthermore, subjects readily combine these geometrical primitives into hierarchically organized expressions. By evaluating a large set of such combinations, we obtained a first view of the language needed to account for the representation of visuospatial sequences in humans, and conclude that they encode visuospatial sequences by minimizing the complexity of the structured expressions that capture them.},

Acquiring expertise means learning these languages -- systems of concepts, alongside the skills to use them. We present DreamCoder, a system that learns to solve problems by writing programs. It builds expertise by creating programming languages for expressing domain concepts, together with neural networks to guide the search for programs within these languages. A ``wake-sleep'' learning algorithm alternately extends the language with new symbolic abstractions and trains the neural network on imagined and replayed problems. DreamCoder solves both classic inductive programming tasks and creative tasks such as drawing pictures and building scenes. It rediscovers the basics of modern functional programming, vector algebra and classical physics, including Newton's and Coulomb's laws. Concepts are built compositionally from those learned earlier, yielding multi-layered symbolic representations that are interpretable and transferrable to new tasks, while still growing scalably and flexibly with experience.},

Many advances have come from using deep neural networks trained end-to-end in tasks such as object recognition, video games, and board games, achieving performance that equals or even beats humans in some respects. Despite their biological inspiration and performance achievements, these systems differ from human intelligence in crucial ways. We review progress in cognitive science suggesting that truly human-like learning and thinking machines will have to reach beyond current engineering trends in both what they learn, and how they learn it. Specifically, we argue that these machines should (a) build causal models of the world that support explanation and understanding, rather than merely solving pattern recognition problems; (b) ground learning in intuitive theories of physics and psychology, to support and enrich the knowledge that is learned; and (c) harness compositionality and learning-to-learn to rapidly acquire and generalize knowledge to new tasks and situations. We suggest concrete challenges and promising routes towards these goals that can combine the strengths of recent neural network advances with more structured cognitive models.},

Many authors have proposed that transferred knowledge from more familiar concepts is a route to one shot learning, but what is the form of this abstract knowledge? One hypothesis is that the sharing of parts is core to one shot learning, and we evaluate this idea in the domain of handwritten characters, using a massive new dataset. These simple visual concepts have a rich internal part structure, yet they are particularly tractable for computational models. We introduce a generative model of how characters are composed from strokes, where knowledge from previous characters helps to infer the latent strokes in novel characters. The stroke model outperforms a competing stateof-the-art character model on a challenging one shot learning task, and it provides a good fit to human perceptual data.},

More importantly, the behavioral patterns observed in children learning kinship terms, under-extension and over-generalization, fall out naturally from our learning model. We then conducted interviews to simulate realistic learning environments and demonstrate that the characteristic-to-defining shift is a consequence of our learning model in naturalistic contexts containing abstract and concrete features. We use model simulations to understand the influence of logical simplicity and children's learning environment on the order of acquisition of kinship terms, providing novel predictions for the learning trajectories of these words. We conclude with a discussion of how this model framework generalizes beyond kinship terms, as well as a discussion of its limitations.},

  abstract = {The ability to learn abstract concepts is a powerful component of human cognition. It has been argued that variable binding is the key element enabling this ability, but the computational aspects of variable binding remain poorly understood. Here, we address this shortcoming by formalizing the Hierarchical Language of Thought (HLOT) model of rule learning. Given a set of data items, the model uses Bayesian inference to infer a probability distribution over stochastic programs that implement variable binding. Because the model makes use of symbolic variables as well as Bayesian inference and programs with stochastic primitives, it combines many of the advantages of both symbolic and statistical approaches to cognitive modeling. To evaluate the model, we conducted an experiment in which human subjects viewed training items and then judged which test items belong to the same concept as the training items. We found that the HLOT model provides a close match to human generalization patterns, significantly outperforming two variants of the Generalized Context Model, one variant based on string similarity and the other based on visual similarity using features from a deep convolutional neural network. Additional results suggest that variable binding happens automatically, implying that binding operations do not add complexity to peoples' hypothesized rules. Overall, this work demonstrates that a cognitive model combining symbolic variables with Bayesian inference and stochastic program primitives provides a new perspective for understanding people's patterns of generalization.},

  abstract = {Humans have a unique ability to learn concepts that rely on hidden, abstract rules, that require relational reasoning, or that have latent combinatorial structure. Often these concepts systematically extend to provide infinite expressive capacity. The canonical example of such a concept is natural language, but these properties can be observed even in simple laboratory tasks. Such concept learning is interesting because it is not found in any other animal species, and it has also proven an elusive target for computational models. This thesis proposes that people represent concepts as probabilistic programs. Thus, learning such concepts corresponds to inducing a latent probabilistic program that generates, and thus explains the observed data. We explore two computational models of probabilistic program induction. The first is based on the notion of a Language of Thought, a grammar-based approach to rule-based concept learning. We adapt this framework to learn probabilistic programs and compare its predictions to the results of a human concept learning behavioral experiment. The second model is based on a novel representation of probabilistic programs as graphs. This representation brings together concepts from functional programming with the theory of probabilistic graphical models, or Bayesian networks. We test the model on two relational concept learning tasks.},

However, these insights often seem incompatible, as the debates between symbolic, dynamical, emergentist, sub-symbolic, and grounded approaches to cognition attest. Mental representations-whatever they are-must share many features with each of our theories of representation, and yet there are few hypotheses about how a synthesis could be possible. Here, I develop a theory of the underpinnings of symbolic cognition that shows how sub-symbolic dynamics may give rise to higher-level cognitive representations of structures, systems of knowledge, and algorithmic processes. This theory implements a version of conceptual role semantics by positing an internal universal representation language in which learners may create mental models to capture dynamics they observe in the world. The theory formalizes one account of how truly novel conceptual content may arise, allowing us to explain how even elementary logical and computational operations may be learned from a more primitive basis. I provide an implementation that learns to represent a variety of structures, including logic, number, kinship trees, regular languages, context-free languages, domains of theories like magnetism, dominance hierarchies, list structures, quantification, and computational primitives like repetition, reversal, and recursion. This account is based on simple discrete dynamical processes that could be implemented in a variety of different physical or biological systems. In particular, I describe how the required dynamics can be directly implemented in a connectionist framework. The resulting theory provides an "assembly language" for cognition, where high-level theories of symbolic computation can be implemented in simple dynamics that themselves could be encoded in biologically plausible systems.},

  abstract = {The notion of a compositional language of thought (LOT) has been central in computational accounts of cognition from earliest attempts (Boole, 1854; Fodor, 1975) to the present day (Feldman, 2000; Penn, Holyoak, \& Povinelli, 2008; Fodor, 2008; Kemp, 2012; Goodman, Tenenbaum, \& Gerstenberg, 2015). Recent modeling work shows how statistical inferences over compositionally structured hypothesis spaces might explain learning and development across a variety of domains. However, the primitive components of such representations are typically assumed a priori by modelers and theoreticians rather than determined empirically. We show how different sets of LOT primitives, embedded in a psychologically realistic approximate Bayesian inference framework, systematically predict distinct learning curves in rule-based concept learning experiments. We use this feature of LOT models to design a set of large-scale concept learning experiments that can determine the most likely primitives for psychological concepts involving Boolean connectives and quantification. Subjects' inferences are most consistent with a rich (nonminimal) set of Boolean operations, including first-order, but not second-order, quantification. Our results more generally show how specific LOT theories can be distinguished empirically.},

  abstract = {The capacity to store information in working memory strongly depends upon the ability to recode the information in a compressed form. Here, we tested the theory that human adults encode binary sequences of stimuli in memory using a recursive compression algorithm akin to a ``language of thought'', and capable of capturing nested patterns of repetitions and alternations. In five experiments, we probed memory for auditory or visual sequences using both subjective and objective measures. We used a sequence violation paradigm in which participants detected occasional violations in an otherwise fixed sequence. Both subjective ratings of complexity and objective sequence violation detection rates were well predicted by complexity, as measured by minimal description length (also known as Kolmogorov complexity) in the binary version of the ``language of geometry'', a formal language previously found to account for the human encoding of complex spatial sequences in the proposed language. We contrasted the language model with a model based solely on surprise given the stimulus transition probabilities. While both models accounted for variance in the data, the language model dominated over the transition probability model for long sequences (with a number of elements far exceeding the limits of working memory). We use model comparison to show that the minimal description length in a recursive language provides a better fit than a variety of previous encoding models for sequences. The data support the hypothesis that, beyond the extraction of statistical knowledge, human sequence coding relies on an internal compression using language-like nested structures.},

  abstract = {The language of thought hypothesis (LOTH) proposes thatthinking occurs in a mental language. Often called Mentalese,the mental language resembles spoken language in several key respects:it contains words that can combine into sentences; the words andsentences are meaningful; and each sentence's meaning depends ina systematic way upon the meanings of its component words and the waythose words are combined. For example, there is a Mentaleseword whale that denotes whales, and there is aMentalese word mammal that denotesmammals. These words can combine into a Mentalesesentence whales are mammals, which means thatwhales are mammals. To believe that whales are mammals is to bear anappropriate psychological relation to this sentence. During aprototypical deductive inference, I might transform the Mentalesesentence whales are mammals and the Mentalesesentence Moby Dick is a whale into theMentalese sentence Moby Dick is a mammal. As Iexecute the inference, I enter into a succession of mental states thatinstantiate those sentences., LOTH emerged gradually through the writings of Augustine, Boethius,Thomas Aquinas, John Duns Scotus, and many others. William of Ockhamoffered the first systematic treatment in his Summa Logicae(c. 1323), whichmeticulously analyzed the meaning and structure of Mentaleseexpressions. LOTH was quite popular during the late medieval era, butit slipped from view in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Fromthat point through the mid-twentieth century, it played little seriousrole within theorizing about the mind., In the 1970s, LOTH underwent a dramatic revival. The watershed waspublication of Jerry Fodor's The Language of Thought(1975). Fodor argued abductively: our current best scientific theoriesof psychological activity postulate Mentalese; we therefore have goodreason to accept that Mentalese exists. Fodor's analysis exertedtremendous impact. LOTH once again became a focus of discussion, somesupportive and some critical. Debates over the existence and nature ofMentalese continue to figure prominently within philosophy andcognitive science. These debates have pivotal importance for ourunderstanding of how the mind works.},

We propose that developmental theories can address this challenge by adopting perspectives from computer science. Many of our best models treat learning as analogous to computer programming because symbolic programs provide the most compelling account of sophisticated mental representations. We specifically propose that children's learning is analogous to a particular style of programming called hacking, making code better along many dimensions through an open-ended set of goals and activities. By contrast to existing theories, which depend primarily on local search and simple metrics, this view highlights the many features of good mental representations and the multiple complementary processes children use to create them.},

  abstract = {Shepard has argued that a universal law should govern generalization across different domains of perception and cognition, as well as across organisms from different species or even different planets. Starting with some basic assumptions about natural kinds, he derived an exponential decay function as the form of the universal generalization gradient, which accords strikingly well with a wide range of empirical data. However, his original formulation applied only to the ideal case of generalization from a single encountered stimulus to a single novel stimulus, and for stimuli that can be represented as points in a continuous metric psychological space. Here we recast Shepard's theory in a more general Bayesian framework and show how this naturally extends his approach to the more realistic situation of generalizing from multiple consequential stimuli with arbitrary representational structure. Our framework also subsumes a version of Tversky's set-theoretic model of similarity, which is conventionally thought of as the primary alternative to Shepard's continuous metric space model of similarity and generalization. This unification allows us not only to draw deep parallels between the set-theoretic and spatial approaches, but also to significantly advance the explanatory power of set-theoretic models.},

Within this framework, inference over hierarchies of probabilistic generative programs in particular offers a normative and descriptive account of children's model building. We consider two classic settings in which cognitive development has been framed as model building: (a) core knowledge in infancy and (b) the child as scientist. We interpret learning in both of these settings as resource-constrained, hierarchical Bayesian program induction with different primitives and constraints. We examine what mechanisms children could use to meet the algorithmic challenges of navigating large spaces of potential models, in particular the proposal of the child as hacker and how it might be realized by drawing on recent computational advances. We also discuss prospects for a unifying account of model building across scientific theories and intuitive theories, and in biological and cultural evolution more generally.},

Unlike popular computer vision systems, humans can flexibly leverage the compositional structure of the visual world, understanding new concepts as combinations of existing concepts. In the current paper, we study how people learn different types of visual compositions, using abstract visual forms with rich relational structure. We find that people can make meaningful compositional generalizations from just a few examples in a variety of scenarios, and we develop a Bayesian program induction model that provides a close fit to the behavioral data. Unlike past work examining special cases of compositionality, our work shows how a single computational approach can account for many distinct types of compositional generalization.},
