# Suggested readings

If you are curious to get a general idea for what we're doing, you can watch [this youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=239aVfgJ-0E). 

There are no essential readings to prepare; The workshop is meant to be a self-contained experience. However, the material will be difficult, so reading some content beforehand can help understand the material more clearly during the workshop. Here are some introductory readings you can try to do to be _better_ prepared. The following readings do not need to be done in order. Rather, they are self-contained, so feel free to pick and choose what you find most interesting.

## Philosophical background

Much of the philosophical background we'll talk about is described in the excellent [SEP entry on the Language of Thought](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/language-thought/). In case you don't know it already, the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy is an incredible collection of publication-level articles on very many philosophical topics, written by experts in the fields.

If you haven't done philosophy before, this reading might be a bit difficult to understand. Please try to figure out exactly where things get confusing and write down a question. You can then send it to me through the 'Ask a question!' section of this website, and we can discuss it during the workshop.

If that's now enough to quench your thirst for LoT-related knowledge, you can also read [the SEP entry on Computational Theories of Mind](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/computational-mind/).

## Technical background

The content we'll overview is covered more in detail in Chapters 1, 5, 13, and 16 of Barbara Partee's [Mathematical Methods in Linguistics](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/230876377_Mathematical_Methods_in_Linguistics). 

## Some pLoT readings

A good short introductory paper to the idea of the probabilistic Language of Thought is Piantadosi et al's [Four Problems Solved by the Probabilistic Language of Thought](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0963721415609581).
