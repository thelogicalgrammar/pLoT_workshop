    "Finally, a short comment on googling stuff. Finding stuff on google is an absolutely social skill for programming, whether you get an error and you have no idea what it means or you need to finds a way of doing something complicated. An important part of this skill is to learn how to _phrase_ your problem in a way that relevant results come up. This skill is hard to teach, and often you need several tries before something relevant comes up, but some words of advice:\n",
    "- Python is incredibly popular and the community is huge. If you have a problem, it's most likely that someone else already had it and there's a discussion / solution out there on the internet.\n",
    "- Don't try to google your whole problem. Think whether you can break it down in smaller problems and google the smaller ones. While it's possible that nobody was in the exact same situation as you, the features of your situation probably are pretty common. To give an extreme example, if you encounter a programming problem in this course you wouldn't google 'Fausto probabilistic LoT why is sum not working', but rather just something about the sum. _Think what's essential to your problem_.\n",
    "- Googling technical questions is not necessarily 'cheating', and normal programming involves constant googling. You need to ask yourself if the googling you are doing is a normal part of the programming. A possible rule of thumb in the context of this course is: Think about how much time you can spend on the exercise, if you have a problem stop and think before you google, but if you feel you're stuck and can't finish within the self-allotted time or if you don't see a way to proceed after a good think, google it.
