# Introduction

This is the material for Fausto Carcassi's one-day workshop on the probabilistic Language of Thought (pLoT).
This workshop consists of four short modules: two in the morning, two in the afternoon. We'll start from scratch and build up to modelling category learning in a pLoT with Bayesian learning algorithms.

Some of the workshop uses [Steven Piantadosi](http://colala.berkeley.edu/people/piantadosi/)'s library [LOTlib3](https://github.com/piantado/LOTlib3). Note that LOTlib3 is slower than other similar inference libraries developed by Piantadosi (e.g. [fleet](https://github.com/piantado/Fleet)). However, we use LOTlib3 for a crucial reasons: it is written entirely in python, which means folks with more python knowledge can easily have a look at what is happening under the hood, and parts of the LOTlib3 code can be explained in class. 

## Structure

The workshop is divided in four sections. The first section focuses on the foundations required to understand the modern approach to the pLoT. The second section contains little introductions to Python, to formal grammars, and to approximate Bayesian inference. The third section provides an introduction to the LOTlib3 library. The fourth section focuses on concept learning in a pLoT through a series of case studies.
